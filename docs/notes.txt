diffusion:
    - better diffusion performance -> worse refernce lpips, better on every other metric
    - hypothesis: it generates clearer picture of the wrong thing
    - therefore, the hope is that it will average out, but this could very well not be the case
    - raw diffusion: 0.43 lpips, after few epochs, best model : 0.42, eventually 0.45
    - the smallest models make small difference,
