Diffusion:
    Benchmark:
        Trained vs Untrained
        Shifted NeuRAD outputs (where we have ground truth - Front Left / Front )
        Ground Truths

        Metrics:
            FID
            PSNR
            SSIM

    Hyperparameter sweep:
        Sweep parameters:
            Strength
            Num Steps
            Train vs Untrained
        
        Across:
            NeuRAD outputs
            Ground truths


    Training:
        Rank
        Noise Strength
        Conditioning
        Scene Specific LoRA

NeuRAD:
    (note: Disable Camera Optimization)
    
    Base NeuRAD vs Base Diffusion vs Diffusion Lora (vs Diffusion ControlNet Lora)  (plot metrics over time)

    Generate Plots for different
        Image + Metrics
        - Ground Truth
        - Diffusion Output (shifted 0m 2m 4m 6m 8m)
        - NeuRAD Output (shifted 0m 2m 4m 6m 8m)

    When to Introduce diffusion
        Across augment_phase
        What strength
        What scheme (constant vs stochastic)

    Key question:
        retain old neurad info vs learn new diffusion info
            retrain: keep metrics high on ground truth
            learn: improve metrics high for shifted
